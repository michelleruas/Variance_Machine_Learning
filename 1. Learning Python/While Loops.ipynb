    "# While Loops\n",
    "For loops are an example of \"definite iteration\" meaning that the loop's body is run a predefined number of times. This differs from \"indefinite iteration\" which is when a loop repeats an unknown number of times and ends when some condition is met, which is what happens in a while loop. Here's an example of a while loop."
