    "# If Statement\n",
    "An if statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips code based on whether a condition is true or false. Here's a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "if phone_balance < 5:\n",
    "    phone_balance += 10\n",
    "    bank_balance -= 10\n",
    "Let's break this down.\n",
    "\n",
    "An if statement starts with the if keyword, followed by the condition to be checked, in this case phone_balance < 5, and then a colon. The condition is specified in a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if that condition is true. Here, the lines that increment phone_balance and decrement bank_balance only execute if it is true that phone_balance is less than 5. If not, the code in this if block is simply skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, Elif, Else\n",
    "In addition to the if clause, there are two other optional clauses often used with an if statement. For example:"
